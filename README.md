Image Classification Using Vision Transformer for Plant Disease Detection  

## Overview  
This project presents a deep learning-based solution for classifying plant leaf diseases using an enhanced Vision Transformer (ViT) model. The model incorporates Adaptive Attention Segmentation (AAS) to focus on infected areas, improving detection accuracy.

## Features  
🔍 Vision Transformer (ViT) for feature extraction  
🧠 Adaptive segmentation (AAS) to localize diseased regions  
💬 Integrated rule-based assistant to guide users on treatment, prevention, and symptoms  
🌿 High performance on real-world plant disease datasets  
⚡ Simple Gradio interface for quick testing and visualization  

## Tech Stack Used  
- Python  
- PyTorch  
- Hugging Face Transformers  
- PIL / OpenCV  
- Gradio (for UI)  
- Google Colab (for training and deployment)
